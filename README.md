# SpiderWorld307
Spider world recreated in Java for CSC 307 Final Project

# Level Editing
To edit levels, open one of the raw text level files in the 'levels/' directory.

* To make a cell be a red diamond, replace the corresponding character with 'R'.
* To make a cell be a green diamond, replace the corresponding character with 'G'.
* To make a cell be a blue diamond, replace the corresponding character with 'B'.
* To make a cell contain the spider, replace the corresponding character with 'S'.
* To make a cell empty/default, replace the corresponding character with anything else.

Be sure to save, then restart the program.

(Note: the levels must be of N*N size and contain only one spider)
